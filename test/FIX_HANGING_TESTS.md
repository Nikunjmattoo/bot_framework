# Fix for Test Suite Hanging Issue (Windows)

## Problem
After running API layer tests, the test suite would hang for a long time on Windows, preventing subsequent test suites from running.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Database Engine Not Being Disposed** - Session-scoped engine in conftest.py never called `engine.dispose()`
2. **Windows-Specific PostgreSQL Connection Issues** - Windows takes longer to release PostgreSQL connections
3. **Transaction Connections Not Properly Cleaned** - Lingering connections in the pool between tests
4. **No Delay Between Test Suites** - Subprocess-based test runner didn't allow time for connection cleanup

## Fixes Applied

### 1. conftest.py (test/conftest.py)

**Changes:**
- Modified `test_engine` fixture to use `yield` instead of `return` and call `engine.dispose()` on teardown
- Added `pool_recycle=300` to engine configuration (recycle connections after 5 minutes)
- Added `engine.dispose()` in `setup_test_database` fixture cleanup
- Improved `db_session` fixture to properly delete session and connection objects
- Added pytest hooks:
  - `pytest_sessionfinish()` - Forces garbage collection and clears all connection pools after entire test session
  - `pytest_runtest_teardown()` - Forces garbage collection after each test

**Key Code:**
```python
@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
def test_engine():
    """Create test database engine (session-scoped, reused)."""
    engine = create_engine(
        TEST_DATABASE_URL,
        pool_size=5,
        max_overflow=10,
        pool_pre_ping=True,
        pool_recycle=300  # Recycle connections after 5 minutes
    )
    yield engine

    # CRITICAL: Dispose engine to close all connections
    engine.dispose()
```

### 2. run_all_tests.py (test/run_all_tests.py)

**Changes:**
- Added 2-second delay between test suites to allow database connections to fully close
- Added timeout (300 seconds = 5 minutes) per test suite
- Added cleanup message to show progress

**Key Code:**
```python
# CRITICAL: Add delay to allow connections to fully close (Windows fix)
print(f"\n  ⏳ Cleaning up database connections...")
time.sleep(2)  # 2 second delay between suites
```

## Testing Instructions

### Run All Tests
```bash
python test/run_all_tests.py
```

### Run Specific Suite
```bash
python test/run_all_tests.py --suite api
python test/run_all_tests.py --suite database
```

### Run with Coverage
```bash
python test/run_all_tests.py --coverage
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. API layer tests complete successfully
2. **2-second cleanup delay** shows: "⏳ Cleaning up database connections..."
3. Next test suite (database/services/etc.) starts immediately without hanging
4. All test suites run sequentially without interruption
5. Total runtime should be: (test time) + (2 seconds × number of suites)

## Database Configuration

Test database details from `test/conftest.py`:
```python
TEST_DATABASE_URL = os.getenv(
    "TEST_DATABASE_URL",
    "postgresql+psycopg2://postgres:admin@localhost:5432/bot_framework_test"
)
```

## Files Modified
- `test/conftest.py` - Database fixture improvements and pytest hooks
- `test/run_all_tests.py` - Added cleanup delays between test suites

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] All API layer tests complete without hanging
- [ ] Database layer tests start immediately after API tests
- [ ] Services layer tests start immediately after database tests
- [ ] No hanging between any test suites
- [ ] Total test runtime is reasonable (< 5 minutes for all suites)

## Additional Notes
- The 2-second delay is conservative and can be reduced to 1 second if tests run smoothly
- The `pool_recycle=300` setting prevents stale connections
- Pytest hooks ensure cleanup even if individual fixtures fail
